{"email_subject": "Huntley followup question", "email_body": "Phillip, I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the lot from when you closed? I would like to see if we'll have any easement problems above or around the garage area to consider. If you find something and it's faxable, please send it to my fax at 281-858-1127. Feel free to call first if you have any comments. Thanks, Bob Huntley 281-858-0000", "id": "21029488_1075858631514_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
