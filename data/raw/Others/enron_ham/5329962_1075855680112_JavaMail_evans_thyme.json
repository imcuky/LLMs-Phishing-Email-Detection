{"email_subject": "Re: SM134 Proforma.xls", "email_body": "George, I received the drawings. They look good at first glance. I will look at them in depth this weekend. The proforma was in the winmail.dat format which I cannot open. Please resend in excel or a pdf format. If you will send it to pallen70@hotmail.com, I will be able to look at it this weekend. Does this file have a timeline for the investment dollars? I just want to get a feel for when you will start needing money. Phillip", "id": "5329962_1075855680112_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
