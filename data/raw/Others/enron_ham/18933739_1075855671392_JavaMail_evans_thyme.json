{"email_subject": "Re: Foundation leveling on #2 & #3 apts.", "email_body": "Mary, I spoke to Gary about the foundation work on #2 & #3. He agreed that it would be better to just clean up #3 and do whatever he and Wade can do to #2. Then they can just focus on #19. I worked on the books this weekend but I need more time to finish. I will call you in a day or so. Phillip", "id": "18933739_1075855671392_JavaMail_evans_thyme"}
